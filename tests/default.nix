# Test matrix for the pull-side mechanism (lib.mkContainer +
# nixosModules.updater/.host). Three checks:
#
#   happy-path      full VM integration test: manifest fetch -> realise
#                   -> symlink swap -> container start, on a REAL
#                   container closure built the same way container-factory
#                   builds one (isStandalone=false at build time).
#   bad-manifest    VM integration test: a missing/unfetchable manifest
#                   fails the stage step safely, without crash-looping
#                   past container@'s StartLimitBurst guard.
#   podman-nesting  pure eval-level structural check (no VM -- a podman
#                   image pull needs network access NixOS VM tests don't
#                   have): confirms usesPodman wires the storage bind
#                   mount, CAP_BPF, and /dev/fuse device that authentik's
#                   real "no space left on device" incident depended on.
